# Output folder
This folder contains **Airbnb_database_to_check.xlsx** which is a file used to check manually for discrepancies between Solstice measures/categories and what AI generated. It contains color coding to speed up the process. Data in this is pasted from **LocalGrantDatabaseEnglandWales.xlsx** which is a raw output file generated by **3_scrape_format.ipynb**

The file **231019 AirBnB Government Grants.xlsx** is then just the current solstice template with data from **Airbnb_database_to_check.xlsx** pasted in.
